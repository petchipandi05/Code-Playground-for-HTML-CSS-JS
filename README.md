💻 Project Title: Code Playground for HTML, CSS, JS 

📘 Concept: 

The Online Code Editor is a web-based platform that allows users to write, edit, and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real time. 
It provides an interactive environment similar to CodePen or JSpin, designed to help developers experiment with front-end code easily.

✨ Features Implemented in This Frontend Version: 

-	Separate editor panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
-	Output panel to display rendered results in real time. 
-	Console panel to show logs and errors. 
-	Run, Reset, and Clear buttons for easy control. 
-	Live preview feature (auto-run while typing). 
-	Resizable split layout for flexible workspace. 
-	Line numbering for better readability. 
-	User authentication pages (Signup, Login, Logout, Profile). 
-	Snippet management UI to save, edit, delete, and view code snippets. 
-	Search and filter options for managing saved snippets.

🔮 Future Improvements (Backend Integration): 

•	Connect to a backend using Node.js and Express.js for storing user data and code snippets in MongoDB. 
•	JWT-based authentication for secure login and session management. 
•	Persistent snippet storage, allowing users to access their saved code anytime. 
•	User dashboard API integration to display personalized snippets. 
•	Error logging and analytics for better debugging support. 
•	Snippet sharing and collaboration features for users to work together.
